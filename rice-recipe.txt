Ingriedients:
- Rice
- Onions
-Salt

Directions:
1. Wash your Rice about 3 to 4 times.
   Be careful on the amount of rice, it swells up very quickly
2. Fill up the rice with water. Not too much or too little. You don't want it undercooked 
    or overcooked. Typically the water fills up to 2x the size of the rice
3. Add chopped onions and salt. You want just a trickle of salt depending on the amount of rice.
    The onions shouldnt be much also.
4. You wait till its ready and if its too strong, you add more water. Ifs its too soft, well
    try not to add much water next time
5. Its served with sauch of your choice. I prefer mine with stew and cow leg ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‹
